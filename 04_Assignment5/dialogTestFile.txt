# Comments are made using hashtags and should be ignored just as they are in python.
# This is a test document. The point of this document is to test each rule the robot 
# is meant to follow while speaking. The testing is progressive, meaning that each
# test adds/tests one new rule. This way, a user would be able to quickly identify
# if/where the robot has gone wrong.
